# Rest API - Part I

1. Design the `Movies` API.


2. Create a new Express project from scratch. 


3. Start implementing the REST API that does the **R** in CRUD over `Movies`. 

For this week you only need to implement the **GET** requests.

Make sure that you follow the REST conventions we talked about last week.

 
Validation is optional in this assignment. I will personally not have a fixed schema and thus allow users to define any type of content as long as they don’t overwrite the id.


Don't work with databases or use a persistence layer. Do everything in memory with variables. 

The biggest challenge is to consider the appropriate data type for the resources. 

 
**Hand-in**: Since we will solve it in class, there is no hand-in. Please do it in advance, though.
